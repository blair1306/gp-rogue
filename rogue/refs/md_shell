 * This function spawns a shell for the user to use.  When this shell is
 * terminated, the game continues.  Since this program may often be run
 * setuid to gain access to privileged files, care is taken that the shell
 * is run with the user&apos;s REAL user id, and not the effective user id.
 * The effective user id is restored after the shell completes.
