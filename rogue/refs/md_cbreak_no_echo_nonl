<doc f='codebrowser/machdep.c' l='577'>/* md_cbreak_no_echo_nonl:
 *
 * This routine sets up some terminal characteristics.  The tty-driver
 * must be told to:
 *   1.)  Not echo input.
 *   2.)  Transmit input characters immediately upon typing. (cbreak mode)
 *   3.)  Move the cursor down one line, without changing column, and
 *        without generating a carriage-return, when it
 *        sees a line-feed.  This is only necessary if line-feed is ever
 *        used in the termcap &apos;do&apos; (cursor down) entry, in which case,
 *        your system should must have a way of accomplishing this.
 *
 * When the parameter &apos;on&apos; is true, the terminal is set up as specified
 * above.  When this parameter is false, the terminal is restored to the
 * original state.
 *
 * Raw mode should not to be used.  Keyboard signals/events/interrupts should
 * be sent, although they are not strictly necessary.  See notes in
 * md_heed_signals().
 *
 * This function must be implemented for rogue to run properly if the
 * program is compiled with CURSES defined to use the enclosed curses
 * emulation package.  If you are not using this, then this routine is
 * totally unnecessary.
 *
 * Notice that information is saved between calls.  This is used to
 * restore the terminal to an initial saved state.
