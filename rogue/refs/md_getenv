 *
 * This routine gets certain values from the user&apos;s environment.  These
 * values are strings, and each string is identified by a name.  The names
 * of the values needed, and their use, is as follows:
 *
 *   TERMCAP
 *     The name of the users&apos;s termcap file, NOT the termcap entries
 *     themselves.  This is used ONLY if the program is compiled with
 *     CURSES defined (-DCURSES).  Even in this case, the program need
 *     not find a string for TERMCAP.  If it does not, it will use the
 *     default termcap file as returned by md_gdtcf();
 *   TERM
 *     The name of the users&apos;s terminal.  This is used ONLY if the program
 *     is compiled with CURSES defined (-DCURSES).  In this case, the string
 *     value for TERM must be found, or the routines in curses.c cannot
 *     function, and the program will quit.
 *   ROGUEOPTS
 *     A string containing the various game options.  This need not be
 *     defined.
 *   HOME
 *     The user&apos;s home directory.  This is only used when the user specifies
 *     &apos;~&apos; as the first character of a saved-game file.  This string need
 *     not be defined.
 *   SHELL
 *     The user&apos;s favorite shell.  If not found, &quot;/bin/sh&quot; is assumed.
 *
 * If your system does not provide a means of searching for these values,
 * you will have to do it yourself.  None of the values above really need
 * to be defined except TERM when the program is compiled with CURSES
 * defined.  In this case, as a bare minimum, you can check the &apos;name&apos;
 * parameter, and if it is &quot;TERM&quot; find the terminal name and return that,
 * else return zero.  If the program is not compiled with CURSES, you can
 * get by with simply always returning zero.  Returning zero indicates
 * that their is no defined value for the given string.
