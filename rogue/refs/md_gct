<doc f='codebrowser/machdep.c' l='292'>/* md_gct(): (Get Current Time)
 *
 * This function returns the current year, month(1-12), day(1-31), hour(0-23),
 * minute(0-59), and second(0-59).  This is used for identifying the time
 * at which a game is saved.
 *
 * This function is not strictly necessary.  It can be stubbed by returning
 * zeros instead of the correct year, month, etc.  If your operating
 * system doesn&apos;t provide all of the time units requested here, then you
 * can provide only those that it does, and return zeros for the others.
 * If you cannot provide good time values, then users may be able to copy
 * saved-game files and play them.
