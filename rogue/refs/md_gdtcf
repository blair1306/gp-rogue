<doc f='codebrowser/machdep.c' l='643'>/* md_gdtcf(): (Get Default Termcap File)
 *
 * This function is called ONLY when the program is compiled with CURSES
 * defined.  If you use your system&apos;s curses/termlib library, this function
 * won&apos;t be called.  On most UNIX systems, &quot;/etc/termcap&quot; suffices.
 *
 * If their is no such termcap file, then return 0, but in that case, you
 * must have a TERMCAP file returned from md_getenv(&quot;TERMCAP&quot;).  The latter
 * will override the value returned from md_gdtcf().  If the program is
 * compiled with CURSES defined, and md_gdtcf() returns 0, and
 * md_getenv(&quot;TERMCAP&quot;) returns 0, the program will have no terminal
 * capability information and will quit.
