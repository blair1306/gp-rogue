<doc f='codebrowser/machdep.c' l='323'>/* md_gfmt: (Get File Modification Time)
 *
 * This routine returns a file&apos;s date of last modification in the same format
 * as md_gct() above.
 *
 * This function is not strictly necessary.  It is used to see if saved-game
 * files have been modified since they were saved.  If you have stubbed the
 * routine md_gct() above by returning constant values, then you may do
 * exactly the same here.
 * Or if md_gct() is implemented correctly, but your system does not provide
 * file modification dates, you may return some date far in the past so
 * that the program will never know that a saved-game file being modified.
 * You may also do this if you wish to be able to restore games from
 * saved-games that have been modified.
