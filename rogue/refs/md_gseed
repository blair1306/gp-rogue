 *
 * This function returns a seed for the random number generator (RNG).  This
 * seed causes the RNG to begin generating numbers at some point in it&apos;s
 * sequence.  Without a random seed, the RNG will generate the same set
 * of numbers, and every game will start out exactly the same way.  A good
 * number to use is the process id, given by getpid() on most UNIX systems.
 *
 * You need to find some single random integer, such as:
 *   process id.
 *   current time (minutes + seconds) returned from md_gct(), if implemented.
 *
 * It will not help to return &quot;get_rand()&quot; or &quot;rand()&quot; or the return value of
 * any pseudo-RNG.  If you don&apos;t have a random number, you can just return 1,
 * but this means your games will ALWAYS start the same way, and will play
 * exactly the same way given the same input.
